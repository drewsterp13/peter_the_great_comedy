### **Plot Overview:**

**Act 1**:  
Peter the Great, young, impulsive, and determined to drag Russia into the modern age, embarks on his *Grand Embassy* across Europe. His goal is to learn the latest European technologies, naval tactics, and to form alliances with powerful rulers. What he didn’t expect? A wild, chaotic tour filled with awkward diplomacy, ridiculous cultural misunderstandings, and constant distractions.

He’s accompanied by a motley crew of Russian nobles who are less interested in modernization and more excited about the European food, drinks, and partying. Peter, disguising himself as a low-ranking soldier (because he thinks it’ll make his experience more "authentic"), realizes his reputation precedes him and his disguise fools no one. From the start, things are chaotic—Peter’s huge size, booming voice, and outlandish ideas make it impossible for him to blend in.

**Act 2**:  
In each country he visits, Peter finds himself embroiled in absurd situations:

- **Amsterdam**: Peter tries to learn shipbuilding by working incognito at a Dutch shipyard. However, his enthusiasm for tools and machinery results in countless disasters—he accidentally sinks a half-built ship and sets fire to a windmill. Despite the chaos, the Dutch love him for his sheer enthusiasm.

- **France**: In Versailles, Peter’s lack of courtly manners causes endless embarrassment. He finds Louis XIV’s endless etiquette rules maddening, leading to a slapstick sequence of Peter trying to master ballroom dancing, wearing absurdly frilly French clothing, and accidentally insulting French aristocrats with his blunt honesty.

- **England**: Peter is fascinated by the navy and asks to board a royal ship. However, things go awry when he insists on firing the cannons for “fun,” nearly causing an international incident. He tries to impress the British Parliament but accidentally knocks over a bust of the King and spends the rest of the visit apologizing in increasingly ridiculous ways.

- **Prussia**: Peter meets Frederick I, who is equally eccentric. The two get into a "who's more powerful?" competition involving absurd feats of strength, hunting contests, and overeating, much to the chagrin of their diplomats who are trying to secure an actual alliance.

**Act 3**:  
Peter's embassy starts running low on funds due to all the mishaps, but despite the chaos, he’s learned a lot about Europe (in his own bizarre way). He’s inspired to build a navy, modernize Russia’s army, and create a more cultured society. However, Peter’s attempts at diplomacy have backfired spectacularly—he’s managed to offend or alienate most of the European leaders he was trying to impress.

In the end, though, Peter’s sincerity and larger-than-life personality win people over. The European powers agree to help him, but mostly because they find him entertaining. The film ends with Peter returning to Russia, triumphant, with a fleet of Western experts in tow—ready to reshape his nation, armed with questionable European skills, and a lot of wild stories.

**Closing Scene**:  
As Peter proudly sails back to Russia, he’s seen giving his crew random, often contradictory orders, trying to apply everything he learned in Europe at once—ending with the ship swerving wildly but somehow, hilariously, staying afloat.

**Tone & Style**:  
Think of the tone as a cross between *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* and *The Death of Stalin*—irreverent, farcical, but with clever satire about the clash of cultures and Peter’s obsession with modernization. The humor comes from Peter’s outsized personality, his well-meaning but clumsy approach to diplomacy, and the absurdity of 17th-century European courtly life seen through his eyes.
